# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a portfolio page using semantic HTML elements
- Structured the page with header, main content sections, and footer
- Improved accessibility with skip link and alt text for images

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The header element is used for introductory content such as my name and personal information.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio section and Areas of Interest section
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Section elements group related content together and give clear structure to the page.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around images and embedded video
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  These elements associate media with descriptive text, improving meaning and accessibility.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link so keyboard users can jump directly to main content
- Added alt text to all images for screen readers
- Used correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2)

These features improve usability for users with assistive technologies.

## 4. What I learned
- How to use semantic HTML to structure a webpage properly
- Why accessibility is important even without visual design

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more detailed descriptions for accessibility
- Further learning about advanced accessibility techniques

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: Basic semantic structure guidance
- What I modified manually: Text content and personal details
