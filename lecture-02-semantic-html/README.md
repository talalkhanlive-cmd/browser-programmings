# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a portfolio page using semantic HTML elements
- Structured the page with header, main content sections, and footer
- Improved accessibility using skip link and alt text for images

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The `<header>` element is used for introductory content such as my name and short personal information.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio section and Areas of Interest section
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  `<section>` groups related content under a clear heading, making the page structure logical and meaningful.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around project images and embedded video
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  These elements associate media with descriptive text, improving accessibility and semantic meaning.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip link to allow keyboard users to jump directly to main content
- Added alt text to all images for screen readers
- Used correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2)

These features improve usability for users with assistive technologies.

## 4. What I learned
- How to use semantic HTML elements instead of generic divs
- Why accessibility is important even without visual design

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more descriptive alt text
- Learning more about advanced accessibility techniques
