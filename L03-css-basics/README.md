# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Linked an external CSS file to the HTML
- Applied basic typography for readability
- Used margin and padding to control spacing
- Styled header and footer for better structure
- Made images responsive to avoid overflow

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selector (body, h1, img)
- Group selector (header, footer)
- Descendant selector (main section)
- ID selector (#main)
- Class selector (.card)
- Pseudo-class (a:hover)

## One thing I struggled with
- Understanding the difference between margin and padding

## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve layout and visual design while keeping accessibility
